            . I am currently interning at Slang Labs. When not working, you can
            find me reading books, playing games with friends, working on some
            new idea, or sleeping üò¥ .

            <br />I love working with React. Not a fan of Class Based
            components. More like Functional Components + Hooks + Typescript.

            Firstly because I love the movie Kung Fu Panda and I relate to Po so
            much. Just like him, I am determined to do whatever I decide to do
            and will persevere till the end while being lazy and a complete
            procastinator üòÜ. Now you know why you'll find a panda as a DP on my
            socials üêº.
